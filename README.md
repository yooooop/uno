# To run

Download the assets and put all the files in the same folder. 
Then refer to this link if you are an eclipse user. 
https://help.eclipse.org/2019-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Ftasks%2Ftask-launching_java_applet.htm

You can also use JCreator or other IDEs.

DISCLAIMER:

The original has a background music file that could not be uploaded due to its file size. So if you wish to run this file with background music, a background.wav is required to be in the same folder as the assets to run it. If you are ok without the music, simply delete the lines with the comment "//DELETE THIS LINE TO PLAY WITHOUT BGM" of the unoback.java file.
